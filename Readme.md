# Full Stack CastingAgency  Backend Project
The Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. You are an Executive Producer within the company and are creating a system to simplify and streamline your process.

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 
- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

## Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
(linux/macOS/window bash ) createdb castingagency
(windows10 -- PSQL terminal) CREATE DATABASE castingagency
```

## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application.

## Setting up Authorization

### Setup Auth0

1. Create a new Auth0 Account
2. Select a unique tenant domain
3. Create a new, single page web application
4. Create a new API
    - in API Settings:
        - Enable RBAC
        - Enable Add Permissions in the Access Token
5. Create new API permissions:
    - `GET /actors and /movies`
    - ` DELETE /actors/ and /movies/`
    - `POST /actors and /movies `
    - `PATCH /actors/ and /movies/`
6. Create new roles for:
    - Assistant
        - can `GET /actors and /movies`
    - Director
        - `GET /actors and /movies`
        - ` DELETE /actors/ and /movies/`
        - `POST /actors and /movies `
    - Producer
        - can perform all actions
7. Test your endpoints with [Postman](https://getpostman.com) or with cURL as mentioned below in the testing section.
      - Register 3 users - assign the Assistant role to one and Director role to the other and last one to Producer.
      - Sign into each account and make note of the JWT .
    
## Testing the API with cURL or Postman
In order to test your API , we have 2 ways Either to use cURL or [Postman](https://getpostman.com) collection  . You have to save $TOKEN_VALUE and replace it with its value in the URL of the curl or postman . you have to choose the way that is more convenient to you . If you chose to use Postman . So , you must send the token in the Authorization tab .

## Test using unit testing 
unit testing is already implmented in the ```test_app.py``` with Test driven development concept . in order to test the APP with its Authorization run the following command . 
## Samples of Postman and cURL

[Get:actors](
[link text](http://example.com/))

``` curl --location --request GET 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/actors' \ --header 'Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_VALUE```

or using Postman send the following request :

```http://127.0.0.1:5000/actors``` .

Response

```{'Actors':[{'age': 20,'gender': 'Female','id': 1,'name': 'Nada',},{'age': 22,'gender': 'female','id': 2,'name': 'arwa',},{'age': 10,'gender': 'female','id': 3,'name': 'mai',}],'success': true}```

* Get:actors
```curl  --request GET 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/movies' \--header 'Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_VALUE```
or using Postman send the following request :

the unit testing of that api is already found in test_app.py 

```cd into your project directory ```
```bash setup2.sh```
